 TUMALOG FALLS
</div>
<br><p style="font-size:160%"></p>
<p>
  Tumalog Falls is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Southern Cebu. It’s located in the coastal municipality of Oslob and it’s only a few kilometers away from the famous Whale Shark Site in Barangay Tan-awan.
  It is a great addition to your Southern Cebu Adventure because of its natural beauty and cool waters.<br>
  The view is magnificent! The rushing pristine water carved its rocks into beautiful figures. The cool turquoise water saturated the plunge pool and the towering trees populated its home like a scene in a fantasy movie. 
  Sunlight dappled the surface with glistening colors making this waterfall an eye-candy for every travelers. Aside from taking taking picture there you can also swim, there are pool and approximately it is measured by 4-5 feet.<br>
 <b>HOW TO GET THERE?</b><br>
	This is what we did in order for you visit and experienced the Tumalog Falls. From our Hotel in Tan-awan,Oslob, we asked the driver to get a habal-habal ride going to Tumalog Falls. A round trip from the inn falls costs around PHP 300 (USD 5.70) per person.
	When you arrived in the entrance gate going to the falls, you have to ride another habal-habal going down to the falls. The habal-habal riders are doing a specific rotation in the area.
There are riders assigned to provide transportation for Tumalog Falls and while the others are assigned for the whale shark watching. It is a form of courtesy, respect, and even share of work among the riders of Oslob. 
A round trip from the entrance gate going to the falls costs PHP 50 (USD 0.95) per person. If you don’t want to spend PHP 50 (USD 0.95), you can walk from the gate going down to the falls.
But the road going down is really steep! After your visit from the falls, you will be exhausted going back up to the gate. Treat the PHP 50 (USD 0.95) as a form of help and donation for the locals.
And all of the expenses will be worth it.<br></p>
